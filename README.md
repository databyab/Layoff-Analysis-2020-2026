# Layoff-Analysis-2020-2026

This project analyzes global tech layoffs from 2020 to 2026 to uncover trends across time, industry, company stage, and geography using Python and exploratory data analysis.

Key Insights
1. Layoffs show clear seasonality, peaking in January and late Q4, likely driven by budget resets and year-end cost cutting.
2. Large, post-IPO companies account for the highest number of layoffs in absolute terms.
3. Early-stage startups (Seed–Series B) experience the most severe layoffs, often cutting a large percentage of their workforce.
4. Retail, Consumer, and Hardware industries recorded the highest total layoffs.
5. AI and Legal industries show the lowest absolute layoffs, indicating continued demand for specialized roles.
6. The United States leads in total layoffs, reflecting its concentration of tech firms.

Approach
1. Cleaned and analyzed real-world layoff data with missing values preserved where appropriate.
2. Distinguished between total layoffs (scale) and percentage laid off (severity).
3. Visualized trends using Python (pandas, matplotlib).
