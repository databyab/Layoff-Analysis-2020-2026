Layoff Analysis Summary (2020–2026)

This project analyzes global tech layoffs from 2020 to 2026 to identify
patterns across time, geography, industry, and company stage.

Key Findings:

1. Overall Trend
- Layoffs show clear seasonality, with major spikes in January and late Q4.
- These peaks align with budget resets, earnings cycles, and year-end cost cutting.
- Mid-year months generally show lower layoff activity.

2. Geography
- The United States accounts for the highest number of layoffs, reflecting its
  dominance in the global tech industry.
- Countries with strong startup ecosystems, such as Israel and India, also show
  notable layoff activity.
- Layoffs outside the US are more frequent among smaller and early-stage firms.

3. Industry Impact
- Consumer, Retail, and Technology-related industries experienced the highest
  total layoffs.
- AI and Legal are among the least affected industries in terms of total job losses.

4. Company Stage
- Early-stage companies (Seed, Series A, Series B) exhibit the highest layoff
  severity, often cutting a large percentage of their workforce.
- Later-stage and Post-IPO companies contribute the largest absolute number of
  layoffs but generally reduce a smaller share of employees.

5. Severity vs Scale
- Total layoffs measure the scale of job losses.
- Percentage laid off captures company-level impact and risk.
- Many early-stage companies recorded near-total or complete workforce reductions,
  indicating shutdown events.

6. Data Considerations
- Missing values in layoff counts and percentages reflect non-disclosure by
  companies rather than data quality issues.
- Numeric values were not artificially filled to avoid misleading conclusions.

Conclusion:
Economic downturns affect companies unevenly. Large firms absorb shocks through
large but proportional cuts, while smaller and early-stage companies face
significantly higher risk of severe layoffs or closure.
